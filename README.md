# design-patterns
Short projects showcasing design pattern implementations.

The purpose of this repository is to provide simple demonstrations of software design patterns.
These design patterns are primarily taken from the Gang of Four design patterns book. Most of
these examples will be written in C#.

### Current Patterns
* Data Mapper
* Factory
* Factory Delegate
* Singleton

There is not much here yet, but I plan to add patterns over the next year or so.
